This algorithm reads a mesh, renderize it, calculate the curvatures and automatically segment it
developed in C++

In data folder you can find some teeth mold samples.
You can find the implemented classes in vertex.h, polygon.h and mesh.h

Sorry, it is not very user friendly. You will have to make some modifications to use the classes for other purposes, but feel free to use the classes.
